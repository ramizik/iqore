Our project is an "iQore AI Chat Assistant," designed to provide support and answer questions about iQore and its work.

**Frontend Implementation:**
The frontend is built using a classic web stack: HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript. We've focused on creating a modern, visually appealing user interface with custom CSS, incorporating gradients, blur effects, and responsive design for an optimal experience across devices. Key features include dynamic message display, a typing indicator for AI responses, and automatic chat scrolling. The AI avatar image is sourced from Pexels.

**Backend Implementation:**
The backend logic for processing chatbot requests will be handled by AWS Lambda functions, written in JavaScript. These Lambda functions will integrate with the OpenAI Agent SDK to power the AI's conversational capabilities. The frontend communicates with the Lambda functions via standard HTTP POST requests.

**Overall Architecture:**
This setup provides a clear separation of concerns, with a lightweight, performant frontend interacting with a scalable, serverless backend for AI processing.
